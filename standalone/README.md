# svg-regionmap/standalone
An out-of-the-box example of an SVG Regionmap showing each status in traffic light colors which runs standalone in an up-to-date Browser.

A HTML file loads an SVG image and manipulates this  with D3.js.
On laod one color is set for example. A Button changes on click a color of another example.

In real case, some kind of data can conditionally set the color of each region on the map.
By changing those data, for example by pressing the Button, the colors are updated.

Since this is only a case study by now to develop a Design Studio extension (SDK component) to do this there, this example might never be finished.
